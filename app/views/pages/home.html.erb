<h2>Study</h2>
<p>
    Daily scripture study is an essential part of spirituality. 
    Studying the word of God keeps our minds pointed towards Him and gives us perspective throughout our day. 
    For those of us preparing to go on missions or doing any other type of teaching, study is also a pre-requisite (<a href="http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11.21?lang=eng#20" target="_blank">D&amp;C 11:21</a>). 
    During this program, you will read the entire Book of Mormon, do daily topical study and read the words of our living prophets. 
    The study portion of the program should take approximately one hour each day. 
    That may seem like a lot of time, but as you do your best to be consistent each day, you will find yourself looking forward to the study instead of it feeling like something that you are required to do.

<h2>Action</h2>
<p>
	The Gospel of Jesus Christ is not just studying; it's a program of action. 
	We seek learning by study, but also by faith (<a href="http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118?lang=eng#117" target="_blank">D&amp;C 88:118</a>). 
	We need to put into action what we learn with regular daily and monthly activities to apply what we learn and become who Heavenly Father wants us to become. 
	During this program, you will focus on meaningful prayer, pondering, service, temple attendance, fasting and journal writing to make the Gospel one of action in your life.
</p>

<h2>Do Your Best</h2>
<p>
	The program that is outlined on this site is an intense one. 
	Those who keep up with the schedule will be blessed for their efforts and dedication. 
	However, if you are less than perfect at following the schedule, don't worry. 
	Do the best that you can and keep moving forward. 
	If you miss study, you can either start where you left off, or just keep following the schedule. 
	You may try to catch up during days when your study session seems light or when you have extra time. 
	Or, you can just wait until youÂ’ve finished the 90 days and add some extra days on the end to do what you missed.
